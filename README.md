# DCGAN
A DCGAN model created based on the findings from this paper https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.06434.pdf

note: for this to work the celabA dataset has to be included in the project folder

also note: this model was only trained for ~3 eopchs on the celebA dataset so the product of its training isnt the best it could be, but with simply training it longer (~100 epochs), the model could easily achieve much better and photo-realistic results
